Quilter Advisor Assistant A RAG-based question answering system built on Quilter advisor support documentation. 

Setup:
Clone the repo, add your OpenAI key in a .env file, place PDFs in quilter_pdfs_advisor_support_material, and run notebook.ipynb from the start. 

The notebook builds the Chroma DB automatically and answers questions using only the PDFs.
